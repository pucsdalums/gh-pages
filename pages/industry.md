**PRESENTATION MATERIAL**

Since English communication is an issue for the students, it’s important that there are few slides accompanying the talk track. This will help students digest the material from listening and reading the slides.

Adding ‘Learn More’ slide will be super helpful.

**LOGISTICS**

The invites to the session will be sent by the PUCSD LevelUP Core team. The session will be recorded for later reference. However, we will not release the video immediately after the session to encourage maximum students to attend the live session with the speaker. 

**DURATION**

Each session is for 60 ~ 90 minutes (preference is with the speaker and should be decided prior so that the session can be scheduled for the appropriate amount of time). We recommend atleast 20 - 30 minutes of Q&A .

**DATES**

Let’s decide based on the other sessions. We should have one industry session every month. Specific day and week of every month. 

** This is a living document which will be refined based on the feedback of the first sessions that we do and will be available on the github wiki.
