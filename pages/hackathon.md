### About
Hackathons are group activities for programmers to design ideas through collaboration and implement them fast together on premises. Usually, carried out over non-stop 24-48 hour windows working round the clock. 

For now, we will adapt to the virtual-hackathon model which is individual skill development. The success and feedback from this programme will help create long term group projects.
### Goals 
+ To __improve programming__ skills and unit testing skills
+ To learn how to __collaborate__ and brainstorm together on complex problems
+ To learn how to __plan, design and integrate__ different software components together within a stipulated period of time
The hackathon program at PUCSD consists of the following elements:

### Virtual Hackathon Platform
* We will need to finalize a platform for delivering the hackathons in a sustainable way on a regular basis
    * for short term 3 month, assessment, we intend to use   
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [Hackerrank Contests](https://www.hackerrank.com/contests).
* Selected platform needs to have the following features:  
    * Ability to schedule in advance the start and end of a hackathon
    * Support for three distinct groups - organizers, participants and assessors
    * Automated verification of coding challenges

#### Programming Language/technology
* Start with only 1 programming language to keep things simple
* Add more programming languages/technologies later on based on feedback and engagement levels
*  How do we decide on the programming language ?
    - Go with Python as this is the most popular one and adds value to resume
    - Ask department faculty on what is the most commonly used programming language used by students

#### Frequency & Duration
- On weekends for 48 hours from 12:00 am Saturday to 11:59 pm Sunday
- Two factors need to be kept in mind while deciding the nature and content of the hackathons
    - We do not have first hand information about the technical competencies of the students
    - The initial set of assignments need to be at a reasonable level so that even average and below average students stay interested.
- The idea is to start with a set of individual programming problems and then, depending on the feedback and engagement levels, include group projects that are the norm in conventional hackathons. 
- Frequency for individual programming assignments - Every weekend [too much - 150 people, excitement-factor]
- Frequency of group assignments - Once in a month culminating in a weekend
- Timeline
    - Start in August with individual assignments for 6-8 weeks
    - Start with group projects from mid-Sept/October.

### Building Hackathon Content
- Important to build a pipe of appropriate topics for the hackathon at the start so that it can be sustained
- Reach out to our alumni network for building this pipe
- Initial targets
    - __Individual assignments__: 15 assignments with increasing levels of difficulty.
    - __Group projects__:  6 projects

### Evaluation
The hackathon evaluation will consist of multiple checkpoints.
- Checkpoint 1: _Automatic_
  - Use automatic verification features of platform to check if the programs are producing the correct output
  - Submissions that pass this checkpoint are sent to the 'checkpoint 2'
- Checkpoint 2: _Leverage our alumni for_
    - Providing code review comments for working programs
    - Providing a live mentoring session to the authors of the working programs

#### Incentives 
To sustain the interest levels in the hackathons, we have devised a few possible ways to incentivise participation (to be disclosed later).

<!--
    - Opportunity for top 3 programmers to present their design to the department
    - Certificates by departments
-->

#### Feedback
Optionally, to benefit a participant further some feedback on the code can be provided for the purpose of improvement.

### Mode of operation
Students will be expected to submit their assignments along with unit and system level tests
-  New Hackathon challenge will be launched every Friday evening via a teaser video from an alumni that describes the challenge and the expectations. The details of the challenge will only be available only on 12:00 am Saturday.
- Hackathon is open to students from all years (?) → after 2nd year (? level is different, keep first semester out.). 
- We understand that most students are local residents, life outside the department may influence the weekend effort they are willing to put in.
- Guidelines for the coaches on how to review.(**TBD**)

#### Our Challenge
Group projects may not be feasible until students return to the department as it may be quite challenging for 
students to work remotely on a group project.
- Funding required for using a hackathon platform
- Preventing students from copying code from the internet (oral viva ?)
- Feedback is useful but needs alumni time commitment and may overlap with the mentor program [don’t combine]. Should we allow them to speak to Alumni for advice while the hackathon is active.
