<p>The PUCSD Alumni Mentorship programme aims to foster meaningful relationships between PUCSD alumni mentors and current PUCSD students. These real world experiences and connections will help prepare the students for a successful future. 
A strong mentorship program has the power to mutually benefit mentors and mentees:</p>
<ul class="list">
<li>Students have the opportunity to receive advice, guidance, and perspective from their mentors. Your network is more important than ever and an important step in building your support system. </li>
<li>Alumni mentors have an opportunity to share their story, advice students on academic guidance, career advice and personal development. You invest your time in a rewarding relationship with a student who is eager to learn from you.</li>
</ul>
<p>We invite alumni from around the world to be part of the PUCSD Alumni Mentorship Programme.</p>
<h3 id="who-can-be-a-mentor-and-what-are-the-expectations?"><a class="header-link" href="#who-can-be-a-mentor-and-what-are-the-expectations?"></a>Who can be a Mentor and what are the expectations?</h3>
<p>PUCSD alums who are passionate about sharing their knowledge and resources with the current students. Volunteering as a mentor is a great way to make an impact and stay connected the PUCSD community. </p>
<p>Expectations on commitment:-</p>
<ul class="list">
<li>Minimum duration of one year – August 2020 through April 2021</li>
<li>Approx. 2 – 4 hours of engagement per month per mentee</li>
<li>While we mention mentoring, the relationship could be a combination of mentoring and coaching depending on the context. </li>
</ul>
<p>We want the relationship to develop around topics the mentor and mentee wish to discuss. Some expected topics for mentoring (based on a short survey responded by 19 students in Feb 2020):-</p>
<ul class="list">
<li>What is the nature of work &amp; career paths prevalent in the industry?</li>
<li>How do I prepare for a successful entry into the workforce?</li>
<li>What are the in-demand areas in the industry (cybersecurity, analytics, AI…)?</li>
<li>How do I see the big picture and connect the dots?</li>
<li>What are the higher education options and specializations?</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="who-can-be-a-mentee?"><a class="header-link" href="#who-can-be-a-mentee?"></a>Who can be a Mentee?</h3>
<p>Mentees are current PUCSD students who are looking for guidance as they explore careers, further education and training. Mentees are passionate about growing professionally, developing themselves, learning new skills, navigating their career, and expanding their professional networks. Only 3rd year and 2nd year students may apply for the current A.Y. 2020 – 2021. First preference will be given to the 3rd year students. 
How it Works
A step-by-step process is outlined below:-</p>
<ul class="list">
<li>Mentors and mentees complete online profile (15~25 minutes)
-- Mentor Volunteer Form
--   Mentee Application Form</li>
<li>All Mentors will be invited to a virtual online session to provide a detailed understanding on expectations from you and Q&amp;A. </li>
<li>All Mentees will be invited to a virtual session explaining the programme details and Q&amp;A.</li>
<li>PUCSD LevelUP core team matches Mentees with Mentors based on interest and career goals</li>
<li>PUCSD LevelUP will send an email to Mentor &amp; Mentee confirming the match by end August.  </li>
<li>Mentor sends a meeting request for the first meeting to the mentee in which they get to know each other and also agree how to work together, how long the relationship will last (minimum one year), how they will communicate with one another and expectations. </li>
<li>The Mentor and Mentee have a complete control over the mentorship relationship and decide on how that relationship will work. </li>
<li>Meet as often as agreed via email, phone, video chat etc. </li>
<li>Mentors and Mentees share feedback about your experiences and ways to improve the programme after each academic semester
What if it’s not working?
We appreciate candid, feedback if it’s not working so that we can do a re-assignment. Sometimes ‘rapport’ just cannot be established and we don’t want to force it!</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="what-this-programme-is-not"><a class="header-link" href="#what-this-programme-is-not"></a>What this programme is NOT</h3>
<p>The mentorship programme is not about providing internship or job opportunities – these are led by the PUCSD placement cell and continue to do so. Additionally, it is not about solving academic assignments for the students or any activity that may be construed as providing an undue advantage. </p>
<p>Continuity and Maturity of the programme beyond A.Y. 2020 - 2021
The aim is to get the programme up and running for the current academic year and smoothen out any teething issues with the feedback loops. After the current academic year (A.Y.) hand-it over to PUCSD Alumni Body to scale this by reaching out to the broader alumni and formalizing the process. </p>
